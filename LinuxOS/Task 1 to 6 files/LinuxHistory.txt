Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the
Linux kernel,an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991,
by Linus Torvalds.Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution,
which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most 
of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, 
designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.
